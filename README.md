# Financial Risk Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing an open-source dataset for financial risk assessment, including demographic and geographic information, financial data, risk indicators, and more. The aim of this project is to examine customer financial data to identify risk patterns and enhance loan management strategies. This forms the core of my investigation in this project.

## Analytic Questions Guideline

- Are there geographic patterns in customer risk levels?
- How do age and employment status influence financial risk?
- What are the key characteristics of customers in each risk category?
- Which factors most contribute to a customer being categorised as 'High Risk'?
- What is the relationship between income levels and credit risk?
- Do higher debt-to-income ratios increase the likelihood of default or a high-risk rating?
- What traits are common among customers who maintain a 'Low Risk' rating over time?
- How can we attract more low-risk customers?
- Which types of loans are linked to higher risk ratings?
- How does the loan amount affect risk rating?
- What is the impact of different credit score ranges on loan approval rates and risk ratings?
- How does the payment history affect the risk rating?
- What are the early warning signs of potential defaults?
- How can we manage high-risk customers to reduce the chance of defaults?
- What additional financial products could help mitigate risk or better serve different customer segments?
- How does our portfolio's risk distribution compare to industry benchmarks?
- What are the financial impacts of different risk levels on our bottom line?



## Project Summary Outline
- `Risk Level Distribution`
Majority of customers fall into "Low" or "Medium" risk categories, with "High" risk linked to factors like lower income, more defaults, and lower credit scores.
- `Regional Risk Variations`
Certain countries exhibit higher risk profiles, possibly due to regional economic conditions.
- `Customer Profiles and Loan Needs`
Loan purposes are evenly distributed across different demographics, with no clear link between customer characteristics and specific loan types.
- `Prevalence of Low-Risk Loans`
Most loans are classified as "Low" risk; however, auto loans show a slightly higher incidence of "High" risk.
- `Key Risk Indicators`
High credit scores, longer job tenure, and fewer defaults are common in low-risk customers, while income and debt-to-income ratios alone do not strongly predict risk.
- `Educationâ€™s Limited Impact`
Income does not significantly vary with education level, suggesting other factors influence income.
- `Critical Risk Predictors`
Credit score and payment history are the strongest predictors of risk; other factors (loan amount, purpose, demographics) are less significant.
- `Multiple Risk Factors`
Risk levels are determined by a combination of factors, requiring a comprehensive assessment approach.
- `New Product Opportunities`
Develop tailored financial products (e.g., auto loans for high-risk, personal loans for low-risk) to meet specific customer needs and manage risk.
- `Portfolio Strategy`
The current portfolio is conservative, with potential to expand into higher-risk segments with appropriate risk management.
- `Financial Impact`
High-risk customers drive substantial loan amounts but come with increased defaults; medium-risk customers offer balanced returns but need careful management.
